   - ## Design:

   - ### Theme and Colour Scheme

Variants of Purple, variants of White and blue Color Scheme

List of purples:  #5c0c6c, #a326bc,

List of whites: (#fff), (#f9f9f9),  (#f1f1f1), rgb(255, 255, 255)


- ### Colour theme: 

The reason of choosing these variants of purple to be predominant for this website theme is because purple symbolises spiritual manifestations as well as conveying religious emotions.  

The white colour being a great contraste to purple, these variants of white are used to provide a good visual balance which makes the website to be attractive.

A negligible quantity of blue is used to emphesise the contraste when a button on the navigation bar is active and also when a link is selected. 


- ### Design Brief:

- Colour: The theme colour of this website is based on the colour that the centre already uses for the decoration and the painting of their facilities. 

- Links : Those links lead to social media pages and chanels of the centre (As the project is not yet completed those links open only the home pages of the targeted social media )

- Background: The background is simply a picture of clouds which blends with variants of the purple colour.
