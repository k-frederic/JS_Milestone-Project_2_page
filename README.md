- ## The Reason Why
Once the project is fully completed, the website will be the first point of contact between THANXNAME HOME-STUDIO ENGINEERIN LTD and potential customers. It will provide a clear overview of the company itself as well as information about the company's services, and also it will allow users to request quotations through a form which has to be filled out. 

- ## Objectives to achieve

With this section of the website, the potential customer should find it easy to locate the company within google map and be able to submit a request for an estimate.

- ## (UX) User Experience: 

Users of this quotation request section will start browsing from the first page and navigate by using buttons to click, checkbox and social media links.  The navigation is intentionally coded to restrict users not to be able to use forward arrow once the backward arrow has been used. The only way to navigate forward is the use of " Click here" button at the first page, and at the next page the users must fill out the form to be able to continue; submit their details by clicking "submit" button, and confirm the details entered by checking the checkbox which automatically opens the last page where a congratulation message displays for the successfull submission. 

- ## User Stories

  - #### First-time Users Goals:

  - #### Website Owner Goals:
     - To receive as many quotation request as possible.
